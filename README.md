# kanban-organiser
I started this as a fun React.js side project to learn as much as I can about the framework. 
## Things i did:
- [x] Can change the layout by creating and deleting columns
- [x] Can add and close tasks to each column
- [x] Move tasks between columns using links

## Things i need to finish:
- [ ] Move items between columns using react-dnd
- [ ] Styling
- [ ] Change and show the content of a task
